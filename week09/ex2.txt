In the files decrease.txt and increase.txt data set for 3 page frames.

In the case of decreasing we should make sequence in such way that the element will be refered in the second time only after its replacement. 
1 2 3
4 replaces 1
4 2 3
And when we will refer to the 1, 1 will replace 2


In the case of increasing we should avoid this situations. There should not be the elements which refer only once when they in the page table.
